/**
 * Host-side half of the FSI auto-return. Registered by whichever Activity opened
 * the FSI settings page (the `returnTo`); when [FullScreenWatchService] broadcasts
 * [FullScreenAccess.ACTION_FSI_GRANTED], it re-launches the host to the front so the
 * system Settings page drops behind and the host's `onResume` can react to the
 * grant.
 *
 * `startActivity` is issued from the Activity context (not a background service),
 * which is the path Android allows — mirroring the app's overlay-permission flow.
