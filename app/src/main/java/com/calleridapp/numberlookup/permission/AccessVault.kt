/**
 * SharedPreferences-backed persistence for the Permission Engine.
 *
 * Kept intentionally tiny and independent of the rest of the app's prefs so the
 * engine stays self-contained. Tracks:
 *  - `shown`   → whether a "show once" permission has already been offered.
 *  - `asked`   → whether the OS request has ever been fired (useful for
 *                 rationale / permanently-denied handling by callers).
 *
 * (SharedPreferences is used rather than DataStore to match the rest of this
 * project and to keep the reads synchronous on the main thread — the values are
 * a handful of booleans.)
